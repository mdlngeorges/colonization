["index.html", "Visualizing Colonization Chapter 1 Introduction", " Visualizing Colonization Tabitha Sugumar &amp; Madeleine Georges 2019-12-12 Chapter 1 Introduction The broad topic of this project is colonization. However, we recognized early on that the nature of this subject meant it requires extensive historical work to contextualize data visualizations. Although we lacked deep historical knowledge on the subject, we hoped to use data to explore the potential impact of colonization, and potentially find trends, relationships, and/or indications that could be interesting to examine historically. The questions that intrigued us included: - What is the relationship between colonization and the current economic/social health of a country? - What can we discover about the economic impact of colonialism overtime? - What patterns can we find regarding the way in which countries’ experienced colonialism (level of economic transformation, violence of independence, etc.)? Answering these questions proved to be very challenging. Particularly difficult obstacles to analysis included dealing with vasts amounts of missing data, and concern regarding the accuracy of data in the time period we were interested in. As a result we were hesitant to make any claims based on what our visualization. Despite this, even as we deliver this project we recognize that there is much more to be gleaned from this dataset. For example, it’s possible to go in depth into a single relationship between a colonizing country and one of its colonies – what we do here is a broader analysis that could potentially be a starting point for which relationships could be interesting to look at more closely. This is where we became very aware of the importance of domain knowledge for data scientists. Although we are not in any way historians, we found thinking about the challenges of working with historical data fascinating, and feel that this project is an interesting forray into applying data visualization techniques within the social sciences/humanities.

Several colonies were controlled by different colonial powers over the years, in our analysis we focused on the principal colonial ruler, as designated by the dataset, on the assumption that that country would have had the biggest effect on the colony.

This dataset can be found here. We obtained data on Gini coefficient and the human development index from the UNDP, you can find the information here The actual download we used is a little difficult to find so the direct link is here Please note that this is a direct link to the download so only click on it if you would like to download a copy of the data. We pulled the most recent information we could find for each of these countries in an attempt to think about how colonization may have impacted what is going on in a country today. Of course the time period of colonization was extremely long and complicated, and about 70 years have passed since colonialism ended, so many other factors certainly have an impact. But this was the concept we were hoping to explore. per capita GDP 2017: Represents gross domestic product per capita in 2017. Gini Coefficient: Measurement of inequality, the higher the value, the more unequal the society. These measurements were taken between 2010-2017. There was only one measurement per country, but which year that measurement came from was unclear. We felt that given the span of colonialism, this was acceptable as a method to evaluate a country’s current status. HDI: Stands for human development index. A higher value represents a higher quality of life. Details regarding how this index is calculated and what it measures can be found here 2.3 Angus Maddison Dataset: GDP Over Time The dataset we used to look at GDP over time can be found here This dataset consists of countries and their estimated per capita GDP’s overtime. The Maddison dataset comes from a project has been developing Maddison’s work since his death. These numbers are the most updated versions including recent historical work. The links to the sources provide detailed documentation/explanation of the changes and significance. They provide two types of per capita GDP, one consistent with growthrates and another that ensured the comparative value of goods in a single year was consistent. We chose to use the latter measurement since it seemed more appropriate given our interest in comparing per capita GDP, rather than growth rate. This decision was made based on the documentation provided with the data. We used this data to see if we could look at the economic impact of colonialism overtime and see any patterns. Ideally we would have liked to look at the per capita GDP for a few countries prior to colonization, during colonization, and after colonization. The prior to colonization time period and some of the years during colonization, proved to be difficult as for the vast majority of countries this information is unavailable. In fact, yearly data for many countries only begins around 1950, when colonization ended. This makes sense as the world looked very different then, modern countries frequently didn’t exist, and the level of economic integration. However, it did limit our ability to analyze changes over time. We did our best to use what we had to investigate how countries’ economic situation changed over time and possible relationships with colonialism. 2.4 Colonial Transformation Dataset Data can be found here This Dataset is a product of the Research from Ziltener, Patrick &amp; Künzler, Daniel &amp; Walter, André. (2017). Measuring the Impacts of Colonialism: A New Data Set for the Countries of Africa and Asia. Journal of World-Systems Research. 23. 156-190. 10.5195/jwsr.2017.683. It encompasses 83 Asian and African countries and ranks them according to 15+ indicators in an effort to quantify the type of colonial domination they experienced. The indicators are divided between Political (with a sub-category on violence), Economic, and Social. This data is of a numerical/categorical hybrid nature, as they are numerical encoding of non-numerical (but gradual) realities. (For instance, “Colonial Rule” has been encoded on a scale of 0-5 from 0 for no colonial rule to 5 for direct rule and complete interference from foreign countries.) A summary of all those variables can be found in the github files.

["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Colonial History Data and Adding GDP/HDI/Gini Indicators 3.2 Angus Maddison Dataset 3.3 Colonial Transformation Dataset", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Since we had multiple datasets from different sources which contained data from different time periods and countries, a primary concern was structuring the datasets such that it would be easy to join them as needed for analysis that interested us while feeling secure that we weren’t lose information from mismatched names and the like. For example, when we initially joined the colonial history dataset and modern GDP’s there were issues with countries being named differently that resulted in data loss. Our strategy was to include the iso3 country code for each dataset so that we could easily join datasets on country code whenever needed. 3.1 Colonial History Data and Adding GDP/HDI/Gini Indicators The colonial history dataset included several countries that no longer exist in modern day or that aren’t usually differed to as a separate country. We examined and removed several countries from this dataset for these kinds of reasons. Countries removed: Small states that ended up merging to form Germany and Italy (Germany and Italy are in the dataset). North and South Vietnam since they were only separate during the war (Vietnam is in the the dataset). Zanzibar. Tanzania is included, in fact the modern GDP datset has Tanzania listed twice with too different values (one of these may represent Zanzibar), but given the breadth of this analysis it seemed to make the most sense to remove Zanzibar, and allow Tanzania to be included twice. Czechoslovakia. Both Czech Republic and Slovakia are included in the dataset and since the goal is to compare with on modern data it makes sense to look at these states as they are currently. Austria-Hungary. Both Austria and Hungary and included separately in the dataset. Yemen (one variant). Yemen had three variants, two of which were colonized by the UK, and the other which was colonized with Turkey. We removed one of the UK variants, and gave the Yemen colonized by Turkey the countrycode for modern day Yemen. We felt that without deep knowledge of the political history of Yemen, this was the best choice we could make for the sake of investigating impact of colonialism by colonizing country. Korea (unified). This no longer exists and both North and South Korea are included in the dataset. Since the dataset with the current per capita GDP, Gini Coefficient, and HDI included iso3 codes, merging them was simple at this point. 3.2 Angus Maddison Dataset The Maddison dataset comes from a project has been developing Maddison’s work since his death. These numbers are the most updated versions including recent historical work. The links to the sources provide detailed documentation/explanation of the changes and significance. The dataset had information on England starting from 1200 while information on the UK began around 1700 (there was overlap with information listed for both England and UK). We dealt with this by creating an England dataset with a coloumn for both rgdpnapc and cgdppc (see the data section for an explanation as to the meaning of these values, we ended up only using cgdppc) which merged the UK and England information. If data existed for the UK that is what’s included, otherwise information on England is included if it exists. This seemed a reasonable way to look at the change of GDP overtime in England/UK especially given that it’s per capita, so an increase in population from encompassing more area would be accounted for. 3.3 Colonial Transformation Dataset We used the countrycode R library again to match the ISO 3-char codes with those used in the colonial dataset. We then cleaned the column names for ease of use. They were originally named with over 35-character-long strings that described the indicators and their ranges in detail. We encoded these names with abbreviations, the meanings of which can be found on our github. In our analysis primarily look at PT1/ET1/ST1 which stand for Political/Economic/Social Transformation Indicator 1, and V stands for observed violence. "],
["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Colonial History Dataset 4.2 Angus Maddison Dataset 4.3 Colonial Transformation Dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Colonial History Dataset From this, it seems that most countries have values for most data. There are a few missing values in ColRulerCode, this is because some countries were colonized by Austria-Hungary, which does not now exist and therefore has no iso3 code. Per capita GDP has a single missing value for Taiwan, I’m not very sure why this is the case, it just wasn’t part of the UN dataset. This might have to do with the China-Taiwan conflict. The gini coefficient and human development index adjusted for inequality (IHDI) both have many missing values. That IHDI had more missing values than the human development index (HDI) surprised me, I expected that both HDI and IHDI to have more many, but about the same amount of missing values, and to have more missing values than the gini coefficient. This is because I felt that since HDI requires a combination of information it would be less available. Instead it seems that information regarding inequality is the least available, since this is fairl numeric (involving incomes/wealth) that tend to be reasonably well documented due to taxation, I was surprised that there was so much missing information on the subject 4.2 Angus Maddison Dataset 4.2.1 Maddison Dataset Missing Values in Maddison CGDPpc Missing Values in Maddison CGDPpc after 1800 (The files were saved as images for convenience of viewing and are under the github img/ folder.) Looking at this data it’s clear that there is very little data available prior to 1800, It only exists for select years ex(500,1000,1500). As in the previous chart we can see that as the period between those years is simply empty space. In the graph that provides a closer look at country’s per capita GDP’s after 1800s. Countries with more data available than others include: South Africa, Venezuela, United States, Uruguay, Sweden, Soviet Union, Portugual, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Peru, Sri Lanka, Mexico, Japan, Italy, Indonesia, Greece, UK, France, Denmark, Spain, China, Chile, Brazil, Australia, Argentina These are some countries that would likely be more interesting to look at in terms of gdp overtime, simply because the data is more available. 4.2.2 England Dataset Examining the GDP data available for England we can see that, while there are values at 0, 500, and 1000, a great deal of data in that time period doesn’t appear. This information is not colored yellow for missing simply because those years are not even listed in the dataset. Because the rgdp and cgdp columns combine information on England and the UK they have the most filled values, including every year from about 1200 onwards. We use this data to examine the per capita gdp of England overtime 4.3 Colonial Transformation Dataset Upon inspection, the countries which are missing data fall into the following patterns: - Countries that are missing only one value: Egypt, Jordania, Lesotho. Said values are absent from the original csv presented on the University of Zurich website. - Mongolia, who is missing Colonization beginning and end dates, and has all “present” values set to 0. Similarly: - Singapour, Brunei and Hong Kong, who have no encoded values. All 4 countires, while presented for the database, seemed to have been considered by the researchers as out of the scope of their studies and their scores should not be considered. "],

The only group that comes close is the countries colonized by the Netherlands. The reason for this is likely that the Netherlands’ colonies include Belgium and Luxembourg, both of which have quite high per capita gdp’s currently. It’s likely that in order to understand this we would have to delve into the history of Netherlands, Belgium and Lexumbourg, when they were colonized, what that colonial relationship looked like and when they became independent. Interestingly enough when we look at the lower end of the graph, Belgium’s colonies (it was both colonized and a colonial power) have the lowest current GDP’s. It’s interesting to note that the Belgium has a reputation for being a particularly cruel colonial power. 5.2 Average Gini Coefficient and HDI by Colonizining Country It’s interesting to note that when comparing other average Gini coefficient and HDI not colonized countries are in the middle of the pack, rather than having the best outcome. Interstingly enough, it looks like countries colonized by Japan have the highest Human development index and those colonized by Austria-Hungary have the lowest gini coefficient, meaning the least inequality. A possibly interesting area of further analysis is looking at how these indicators change with time– there is a chance that they fluctuate more rapidly than GDP does and may be more strongly impacted by political factors such as the enstatement of universal healthcare. However, the many missing values have a serious effect on our ability to draw conclusions from this data. ## [1] &quot;Countries Colonized by Austria Hungary&quot; ## State Name Code ColRulerName GDPpc17 HDI17 ## 1 316 Czechia / Czech Republic CZE Austria-Hungary 20325.72 0.888 ## 2 344 Croatia HRV Austria-Hungary 13176.53 0.831 ## 3 317 Slovakia SVK Austria-Hungary 17552.06 0.855 ## 4 349 Slovenia SVN Austria-Hungary 23296.41 0.896 ## IHDI17 Gini ColRuler ColRulerCode IndFrom IndDate IndViol IndType ## 1 0.840 25.9 300 &lt;NA&gt; 315 199301 0 4 ## 2 0.756 30.8 300 &lt;NA&gt; 345 199106 1 3 ## 3 0.797 26.5 300 &lt;NA&gt; 315 199301 0 4 ## 4 0.846 25.4 300 &lt;NA&gt; 345 199106 1 3 ## SecFrom SecDate SecViol Into IntoDate COWsys GWsys ## 1 315 199301 0 -9 -9 199301 199301 ## 2 345 199106 1 -9 -9 199201 199106 ## 3 315 199301 0 -9 -9 199301 199301 ## 4 345 199106 1 -9 -9 199201 199204 ## Notes ## 1 Emerged from breakup of Czechoslovakia (&quot;Velvet Divorce&quot;) ## 2 Polity2 codes earlier indep in 1830 ## 3 Emerged from breakup of Czechoslovakia (&quot;Velvet Divorce&quot;); terr chg includes 1939 secession from Czechoslovakia under German rule (didn&#39;t enter system) ## 4 -9 ## [1] &quot;Countries Colonized by Japan&quot; ## State Name Code ColRulerName GDPpc17 HDI17 IHDI17 Gini ## 1 732 South Korea (ROK) KOR Japan 30025.1957 0.903 0.773 31.6 ## 2 731 North Korea (DPRK) PRK Japan 684.6008 NA NA NA ## ColRuler ColRulerCode IndFrom IndDate IndViol IndType SecFrom SecDate ## 1 740 JPN 730 194808 1 4 -9 -9 ## 2 740 JPN 730 194809 1 4 -9 -9 ## SecViol Into IntoDate COWsys GWsys ## 1 -9 -9 -9 194906 194808 ## 2 -9 -9 -9 194809 194809 ## Notes ## 1 Not coded as leaving unified Korea because 1945 Korea was Jap. protectorate ## 2 Not coded as leaving unified Korea because 1945 Korea was Jap. protectorate While we can see here that Austria-Hungary colonized Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovakia, and Slovenia, which all have similar relatively low Gini coefficients, and thus the average is representative of the circumstance of countries colonized by Austria-Hungary. When we look into Japan’s colonies, there is North Korea and South Korea, but information on both HDI17 and Gini coeffieicent only exists for South Korea, therefore the average is essentially the gini coefficient and HDI of South Korea. Clearly, this demonstrates an issues with the data – due to the many missing values, drawing conclusions from the averages may be tricky. And although a across time comparison would be fascinating, again the availability of the data is difficult. What seems to be fairly clear is that colonialism doesn’t appear to have an extremely strong impact on the current gini coefficient and HDI’s of countries. That isn’t to say that there is no impact, but there isn’t a strong enough one for it’s effect to be readily apparent from the limited data available. While the non economic impacts of colonialism remains an interesting question, the results of looking at these indicators are not strong enough for any commentary. 5.3 GDP per capita Over Time It’s clear that England’s GDP increased drastically following the 1800s, but the reason for that is less clear. The 1800s was also the period of the industrial revolution, which had a huge impact in Europe and then the rest of the world. But it’s possible that the resources England was able to gain as a colonial power spurred the industrial revolution as well. That’s a question that needs historical analysis, in addition to data analysis. But it is clear that as England became a colonial power its GDP increased. There are however a few small drops that occur in the 1900s. Let’s look at the time period between 1900 and 1950 (post World War II all colonial countries gave up their colonies). Unsurprisingly, it seems that large historical trends come out clearly in this data. There is a drop in GDP following World War I, the 30s – corresponding to the great depression, and post World War II. Of course it’s at this point that England lost all it’s colonies. It is however, worth noting that England’s ability to benefit from their colonies was likely decreasing for a longtime prior to this. Let’s see if we can uncover anything about England’s GDP versus those of its colonies. Even restricted to a narrower timeframe, there are too many countries to really interpret this graph. In fact, we can see that much information because at 1950, exactly after the end of colonialism. This makes comparing how a country fared before and after colonialism very difficult. So we’ll pull a few countries out based on what we have data for (these were determined from the missing values analysis). Again the limitation of the data becomes apparent, although Sri Lanka had data extending farther back than many countries it still is fairly limited, understanding the impacts of colonialism overtime from data is clearly a problematic endeavour due to the lack of data available. And making any kind of statement as to trends is impossible since we have strong selection bias regarding what we looked at more closely – what data was available, which does not give us an accurate picture of the situation as a whole. However, interesting observation is that the GDP of South Africa is greater than that of the UK until about 1800, which is around when South Africa became a colony of the UK. Prior to that South Africa was actually a colony of the Netherlands. Making any kind of statement based on this is clearly difficult, the UK’s GDP may have been increasing because of the colonization of other countries and the industrial revolution is likely a factor as well. And the reason that the UK was able to take control of South Africa from the Netherlands is another question. However the fact that we can see the GDP of South Africa decreasing at this time indicates it may be interest to compare the UK’s colonial policies regarding South Africa differed from those of the Netherlands. Or if perhaps it had anything to do with the demand of the kinds of goods/agriculture/etc South Africa supplied changing. Essentially this suggests an area of potential further historical analysis. 5.4 GDP per capita by Years Colonized We then looked at the relationship between the number of years a country was colonized for and their current per capita GDPs, the relationship didn’t seem strong. Most countries were colonized for less than 200 years, and all countries with higher current per capita GDPs fall in this range. All countries that were colonized for around 400 years have fairly low current per capita GDPs. It’s interesting to note that the countries that stand out for having higher current per capita GDPs all have noteable reasons for doing so. Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Bahrain all have significant oil resources (in fact I believe Qatar has one of the highest per capia GDP in the world due to its oil reserves). Singapore and South Korea experienced rapid economic growth as countries among the “Asian Tigers” while post World War II Japan rose in economic strength as an industrial center. Essentially, it seems that of colonized countries those with higher per capita GDPs, the source/histories behind their current economic success is well known. 5.5 Indicators of Colonization 5.5.1 Variables Across Country and Colonizers Plotting a parcoords of all 20-something variable definitely fails into overplotting, so we displayed the ‘summary indicators’, Political/Economical/Social Transformation level, which have the benefit of 1) containing the general patterns of other variables 2) being already linearly scaled to 0-100 values. We plotted them against the gdp, as an (imperfect) metric of current performance of the country. Overwhelmingly so, most countries are concentrated in the lower range of the GDPs. The three top-most (Japan, United Emirates, Qatar) countries in terms of GDPs also report lower-than average and median scores on colonization indicators. It is however good to have a critical viewpoint on this, as the three outliers have very specific colonial history that do not fall into the classic european domination framework as others. This plot allows us to view the plight of countries by their relative colonizers, and identify the “worst offenders”. Netherlands and Portugal come in scoring higher overall than the UK and France, which came as a surprise to us, as we had those first in mind as countries with heavy colonial history. That can be justified by actually noticing that the UK and France both had a much wider colonial empire (see next graphs). As often in statistics, the greater range of countries tends to shrink the mean towards the middle, and as a boxplot shows us the range of the Colonial Transformation (overall summary indicator) is greater for France and the UK. 5.5.2 Correlations of variables (covariance matrixes) Other than the obvious correlations between the different type of violences and their composite counterpart V Total, and the strong correlation between the Total Violence level and the Political Transformation Level (which comes as no surpris when examining that the highest PT values have encoded the most violent situations.) There is a strong negative correlation between PT3 : ‘Instrumentalization of ethnolinguistic/religious cleavages’ and ET7 / ST1 : ‘Mining during colonial period’ and ‘Foreign presence during colonial period’. While we did not grasp an obvious link with the former, it is interesting that a heightened control of a Country’s internal struggles could be an efficient division/control strategy for Colonizing Countries with lower colonial presence.

["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component “The Great Divergence” is a term coined to refer to the great economic growth of European Nations from the early 19th century to the mid-20th, with regards to other countries that Historians place on a similar economic footstep for centuries prior (China, India). A commonly posited interpretation links this to the European colonial empires around that time, and especially in the United Kingdom/India relationship this is a crucial timeframe to look at. We reused the Maddison dataset gdp per capita to plot this in a dynamic graph via plotly, to engage the audience and emphasis the great jump in values. Ideally, we would have plotted this starting centuries before to showcase how the lines remained constant, but we have uneven data points for all countries before roughly ~1820, and had trouble plotting the graphs if we included years were we don’t have values for all countries.

["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion As we went on with our exploration, we felt narrowing the scope at the beginning of the project would have allowed us to investigate a specific relationship more closely, as there seemed to be no shortage of historical perspectives to look at. We found ourselves somewhat overwhelmed as to where to look more closely. But, narrowing it down also required going deeper in domain knowledge/specific history and that seemed to be outside the scope of this project. We were disappointed at times by not finding clearer “trends”, but one of the most important take-aways from this class was how easy it is to stretch and squeeze the data to make trends appear, and if we feel like we have to do so, then we might be looking to confirm our pre-existing assumptions instead of genuinely exploring the data. We were also confronted with the limitations of our data itself. We worked almost exclusively with man-made data, rather than empirical measurements. From the GDP to the indicators, all of our parameters, formula or assessment-based, included human decision and subsequently, bias. In addition, we wanted to look at how the data changed overtime, data which we often did not have, had in an unequal fashion for different observations, or the accuracy of which was very uncertain (the GDP data up to a certain year, for instance, was very approximate). With all of those caveats, the colonial datasets remain rich ressources that try to make sense, in a quantifiable way, of a very complex and time-spanning issue. We hope that our vizualizations contribute to that goal. While ‘inconclusive’, we feel we have learned a lot just by working with the data and getting a better sense of the factors historians might look at more extensively, and the issues they may face regarding quantitative support of their investigations.
