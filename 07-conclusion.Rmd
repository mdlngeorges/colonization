# Conclusion

Answers to the questions

As we went on with our exploration, we felt narrowing the scope at the beginning of the projected would have help us be more focused, as there seemed to be no shortage of historical perspectives to look at and we found ourselves somewhat overwhelmed in where to look more closely. But, narrowing it down also required going deeper in domain knowledge/specific history and that seemed to be outside of our possibilities for this project.

We were disappointed at times by not finding clearer "trends", but it feels like one of the most important take-away from this class was that is easy to stretch and squeeze the data to make trends appear, and if we feel like we have to do so, then we might be looking to confirming our pre-existing assumptions instead of genuinely exploring the data. 

We were also confronted with the inner flaws of our data. First, because we were working with almost exclusively man-made data, and not empirical measurement. From the GDP to the indicators, all of our parameters, formula or assessment-based, included human decision and subsequently, bias. Second, because of the nature of the theme, we deeply wanted to look at evolutions of data overtime, which we often time did not have, or have in unequal fashion for different observations, or had to another level of incertitude (the GDP data up to a certain year, for instance, can purely be obtained because of estimation). 

With all of those caveats mentionned, the colonial datasets remain rich ressources that try to make sense, in a quantifiable way, of a very complex and time-spanning issue, and we hope that our vizualizations, by a small margin, follow in that direction.
While 'inconclusive', we feel we have learned a lot just by working with the data and getting a better sense of the factors Historians might look at out, and the shortcomings they may face, while exploring such events.
