# Conclusion


As we went on with our exploration, we felt narrowing the scope at the beginning of the project would have allowed us to investigate a specific relationship more closely, as there seemed to be no shortage of historical perspectives to look at. We found ourselves somewhat overwhelmed as to where to look more closely. But, narrowing it down also required going deeper in domain knowledge/specific history and that seemed to be outside the scope of this project.

We were disappointed at times by not finding clearer "trends", but one of the most important take-aways from this class was how easy it is to stretch and squeeze the data to make trends appear, and if we feel like we have to do so, then we might be looking to confirm our pre-existing assumptions instead of genuinely exploring the data. 

We were also confronted with the limitations of our data itself. We worked almost exclusively with man-made data, rather than empirical measurements. From the GDP to the indicators, all of our parameters, formula or assessment-based, included human decision and subsequently, bias. In addition, we wanted to look at how the data changed overtime, data which we often did not have, had in an unequal fashion for different observations, or the accuracy of which was very uncertain (the GDP data up to a certain year, for instance, was very approximate). 

With all of those caveats, the colonial datasets remain rich ressources that try to make sense, in a quantifiable way, of a very complex and time-spanning issue. We hope that our vizualizations contribute to that goal. While 'inconclusive', we feel we have learned a lot just by working with the data and getting a better sense of the factors historians might look at more extensively, and the issues they may face regarding quantitative support of their investigations.
