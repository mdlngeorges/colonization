# Introduction

The broad topic of this project is “colonization”. However, we recognized early on that the scope of this subject is very broad and requires extensive historical work to truly understand and contextualize any data visualization. We worked on a subset of numerical data and indicators colonized countries in an endeavor to explore the potential impact of colonization. 

During our research for interesting datasets, we stumbled on Professor Paul Hansel’s Colonial History Data Set (within the Issues Correlates of War Project). We supplemented it with datasets that are detailed further in the project.

We endeavoured to explore:
- What is the relationship between colonization and the current economic/social health of a country?
- What can we discover about the economic impact of colonialism overtime?
- What patterns can we find regarding the way in which countries' experienced colonialism (level of economic transformation, violence of independence, etc.)? 

Perhaps as in correlation with that interestingness, answering these questions proved to be very challenging. Even as we deliver this project there is much more to derive from this data. This is where we are most aware of the shortcomings data scientists face without insufficient domain knowledge. Still, while not being in any way history experts, we appreciated working on such an interesting topic, and feel it is an interesting forray into using numerical tools within the social sciences/humanities.
